## mausoleum
1: a large tomb especially: a usually stone building with places for entombment of the dead above ground 2: a living, easily accessible location where friends and family can come to reminisce with thoughts and memories of our recently passed loved ones in the family

Some basic initial objectives include:
- Static html/js/css code for an attractive, responsive, single-page presentation of all deceased family members
- Simple code=generated graphic showing a simple timeline of all entries
- Simple code-generated graphic showing the relevant branches and nodes of the family tree
- Initially (perhaps, permanently) hosted at http://gennetten.org
