          Judy Wesslen, a beacon of love and resilience, graced this world on September 17, 1950, in Portland, Oregon. As the eldest of four siblings born to Delbert and Virginia Gennetten, she helped embody the spirit of a quintessential 1950s family—a snapshot of postcard-perfect moments.

          Her vivacity knew no bounds, often accompanied by a mischievous glint in her eye. But life took an unexpected turn when, at the tender age of 15=[?], Judy fell victim to a drunk driver. The resulting facial injuries marked the beginning of a lifelong battle with medical challenges—a burden she carried with grace and determination.

          Judy’s journey led her to college, where she initially pursued pre-med studies. However, fate had other plans. She met Jerry Wesslen, and their love story unfolded against the backdrop of Spokane, Washington. Jerry’s successful construction business became their shared canvas, and together, they painted a life rich in love, laughter, and profound purpose.

          Judy’s legacy extended beyond her immediate family. She birthed two remarkable children, Jodi and Jeff, who, along with husband Jerry, stand as living testaments to her unwavering love. But Judy’s heart knew no bounds; she welcomed several other children into her home, weaving a tapestry of compassion and belonging.

          Generosity flowed through Judy’s veins. Her involvement with missions spanned continents—from Maranatha Volunteers International to an Ethiopian home for orphaned children[?]. It is there, amidst the laughter and resilience of those little souls, that Judy’s spirit found its wings. A wing[?] now bears her name—a tribute to her boundless love and tireless efforts.

          As we bid farewell to Judy, let us remember her as a giver, a fighter, and a beacon of light. Her legacy lives on, etched in the hearts of those she touched—a legacy of love that transcends time and space. Rest in peace, dear Judy, knowing that your kindness echoes through eternity. ❤️
