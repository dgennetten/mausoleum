            Celebrating the life of Delbert Donald Gennetten, a beloved husband, father, grandfather, brother, friend, and faithful servant of God. He was a man of courage, kindness, generosity, and wisdom, who touched the lives of many with his smile, his humor, and his faith, and his ability to fix most anything.

            Delbert was not born into an easy life, but he never let that stop him from pursuing his dreams and finding his purpose. He learned from an early age the value of hard work, perseverance, and gratitude. He often told us how he prayed to God for a good wife and a loving family, and how God answered his prayer in a miraculous way.

            His idea to hitchhike his way to Oregon turned out to be the best idea he ever had, because that's where he met the love of his life, Virginia Gardner. They were inseparable from the moment they laid eyes on each other, and they shared a bond that lasted for more than 60 years. They raised four wonderful children, who gave them many grandchildren and great-grandchildren, who were the joy of their lives.

            Delbert was a man of vision and ambition, who always sought to improve himself and his situation. He took his family to College Place, where he became one of the first graduates of Electrical Engineering at Walla Walla College. He was a pioneer in his field, who worked on many projects and inventions that made a difference in the world. He was also a man of service, who used his skills and talents to help others, especially his church and his community.

            Delbert faced many challenges and trials in his life, but he never lost his faith or his hope. He battled Multiple Myeloma, a cancer that took a toll on his body, but not on his spirit. He gave credit to his wife for keeping him healthy and happy, with her delicious food and her constant care. He also gave credit to God for giving him strength and peace, and for showing him glimpses of the glorious future that awaits him.
